            <h3>7th May 2018</h3>
            <p>This sprint turned out to be quite successful for the project. For the last month, I was plagued with “coder’s
                block” and had little motivation to work on the project. After coming back into the project refreshed and
                ready to improve things, I stumbled upon one key problem with the game, it simply was not an enjoyable experience.
            </p>
            <p>The first question on my mind was, “Why didn’t I notice this problem earlier?”. It was quite simple. I had spent
                an enormous amount time optimizing hot code paths and running the game on low-end hardware as well as spending
                even more time making custom textures and audio samples so I could give the game a polished feel, that I
                neglected the “fun” aspect of the game. I wanted the game to be fast so badly that I withheld critical quality
                of life issues from the game. The first example of this was only allowing 10 block drops to be in the world
                at any one time. After increasing this number to 50, which still is quite low, I realized that game seemed
                to be more “fun”, yet I could not put my finger on “why”. </p>
            <p>The next big realization I had about why the game was not enjoyable was because the upgrades were too easy to
                acquire and there was no “skill” component in the game. Why play when there is not an incentive to improve?
                This realization led me to flushing out the crafting system, which I had left abandoned for weeks, and thinking
                up a decent component system so players could acquire upgrades at the optimal rate. Unfortunately, I have
                made the game too difficult but I think that is a big improvement from two weeks ago. In this time I also
                added a leveling system and flushed out how attribute points and attribute properties work, creating a diminished
                returns model to describe how these stats would scale as the player progressed in the game and eventually
                came to the idea of adding unlockable suit upgrades. Currently the only upgrade is at level 3 in which you
                unlock double jump / boosters but this idea of “unlocking” gives the player a stronger desire to progress.
                I am planning more unlockable abilities in the future.</p>
            <p>The last thing that immediately came to my attention were the bugs. Drones would constantly get stuck inside
                the terrain and make it impossible to level up. Drones were completely silent and would surprise kill you
                before the player realized he was in danger. Asteroids would soak up all available drops and make it impossible
                to pick up items until the event stopped (still an issue). The UI system seemed clunky and desperately needed
                quality of life improvements. After I realized the vastness of these issues, I immediately started working
                on removing these problems. As I removed problems, I started adding new features and I quickly got locked
                into an organic, healthy, and productive flow.</p>
            <p>After looking back on the last two weeks, I see tremendous improvement in the user experience and hopefully I
                am on the right track for tackling more long term issues that need to be addressed. Sometimes you just have
                to take a break and recharge before you can crack some of the toughest bugs or design issues or even just
                noticing that things are lackluster and need to be improved. </p>
            <p>Some things that are exciting me about future sprints are the ether subsystem. The ether subsystem allows you
                to downgrade any block into ether which is a currency item. This currency powers new terrain editing features
                such as placing 5x5 swatches through a copy/paste mechanism. New items and recipes also give the game more
                of a dynamic feel and different strategies and play styles are starting to emerge. I am excited to begin
                working on the new dynamic block interaction subsystem which will allow creation of automated machines and
                other exciting contraptions. </p>
